# `Sample Project` - Data Report
All information on the data used in the project is compiled in the data report in order to ensure the traceability and reproducibility of the results and to enable a systematic expansion of the database.

Typically, in the exploratory analysis of the acquired raw data, quality and other issues are identified, which require pre-processing, merging of individual datasets and feature engineering into processed datasets. Therefore, this template provides a separate section for the processed data, which then serves as a starting point for the modelling activities. This needs to be adapted to the specific project requirements.

### Data Quality Dataset 1
#### Data Collection Overview
- Collection Period: Data was scraped on July 2, 2024, ensuring that the information reflects the current job market conditions in the Zurich/Schaffhausen regions within the engineering sector.
#### Data Completeness
- Missing Data: The only column with missing data is the 'salary' column. Missing salary data are noted as "Salary not specified." This missing data was intentionally left as is, due to its unavailability at the source.
#### Data Accuracy
- Verification Process: A random sampling method was employed to verify the accuracy of job titles, company names, and salary details against information available on Jobs.ch and corresponding company websites.
- Results: The sampled entries corroborated the datasetâ€™s accuracy, confirming that the job listings accurately represent the information as advertised on the original platforms.
#### Data Consistency
- Handling Inconsistencies: Salary data was presented in two formats: annual salary and hourly wage. Hourly wages were normalized to annual figures based on a 42-hour workweek multiplied by 52 weeks, ensuring consistency across the dataset for analytical purposes.
#### Data Uniqueness
- Duplicate Analysis: While no identical duplicates were found, the dataset contains multiple entries from the same companies, reflecting different job listings. This repetition is appropriate given the dataset's purpose to provide a comprehensive view of available opportunities in the specified sectors and regions.
#### Data Timeliness
- Relevance: The dataset is highly recent, scraped last week, making it extremely relevant for immediate analysis and use in predicting current market trends and demands.
#### Data Usability
- Accessibility and Extension: The dataset, along with the scraping code available on GitHub, allows for continuous updates and easy access, making it highly usable for ongoing job market analysis. Anyone with access to the scraping code can retrieve updated and current data, enhancing the dataset's utility over time.

### Details Processed Dataset 1
#### Workload Splitting:
The original 'workload' column, which ranged from 0% to 100%, has been divided into two separate columns: 'min_workload' and 'max_workload'. This split provides clearer insights into the range of expected work commitments for each position.
#### Salary Splitting:
The original 'salary' column has been divided into two separate columns: 'min_salary' and 'max_salary'. This split provides clearer insights into the range of expected salary for each position.
#### Contract Type Corrections:
Four instances of contract types were incorrectly scraped. These entries have been manually corrected to reflect the appropriate contract types, ensuring the accuracy of the employment classification in the dataset.
#### Salary Normalization:
Hourly wages have been converted to annual salaries based on a calculation of 42 hours per week over 52 weeks. This adjustment allows for a consistent salary comparison across all job listings.
Data Segmentation:
#### Usage Preparation
The dataset has been segmented into three distinct dataframes for specialized analysis:
- DataFrame for Few-Shot Prediction: Specifically prepared for training a machine learning model using few-shot learning techniques to predict missing salary data. 5 Data Points were taken.
- DataFrame with Salary: Contains all listings where salary information is provided except of the Data in the Few-Shot DataFrame.
- DataFrame without Salary: Comprises listings that do not specify salary details.
